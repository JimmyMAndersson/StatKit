# Central Tendency

Central tendencies describe the notion of a "middle point" in the distribution of a random variable. 

## Overview

The arithmetic mean is the most common example of a central tendency. However, StatKit allows for computation of several different means, as well as modes and medians of data collections. Developers can choose between multiple strategies for both mean and median calculations.
