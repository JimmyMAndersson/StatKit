# Association

Measures of association help determine if and how two variables are related to each other.

## Overview

One of the most common ways of measuring association is by the Pearson Product Moment correlation. However, other methods, such as Kendall's Tau and Spearman's Rho, allow analysts to determine if two variables are related in other ways than just linearly.
